# Introduction

**Learning objectives:**

- Learn about the history of "spatial in R"  
- Navigate terms like Geocomputation, GIS, Spatial Data Science 
- Consider the advantages of CLI  
- Consider the advantages of R

## Foreword 1st edition (R. Bivand) 

**"Doing spatial in R"**:

  - Being broad  
  - Open Source code  
  - Open data  
  - Reproducibility  
  - Learning from similar communities around open source GIS



  1) Engage with the authors and the wider R-spatial community
  
  2) Build your **workflow**

  3) Enjoy it
  
  
## Preface
 
 - target a wide audience: from GIS professional/specialist to useR   
 
 - Intermediate to advanced R user.
 
 The book has 3 parts: 
 
 - Foundations: 7 chapters  
 - Extensions: 4 chapters  
 - Applications: 4 chapters  
 
Each chapter has exercises (with a companion web site) 

## What is geocomputation?

- Start with Stan Openshaw:

> “GeoComputation is about using the various different types of geodata and about developing relevant geo-tools within the overall context of a ‘scientific’ approach.”

- Authors include: reproducibility and collaboration: 

> working with geographic data in a computational way, focusing on code, reproducibility and modularity.

- Part of Geography, expanding the tools used

- GIS (geographical information system/science), geomatics, geoinformatics, spatial information science, geographical data science, spatial data science (not mention by the authors) : more overlaps than difference.

## Why R 

### CLI vs GUI

- Command Line Interface (CLI) faster than a GUI

Example:  Broadband Analyst checking Networks

Current workflow: 

1. Download Data from gov. agency (web browser)  
2. Check the data in QGIS (eyeball data)
2b. Correct data 
3. Transform to an appropriate CRS (coordinate system)
4. Create a buffer
5. Transform buffer to the previous CRS
6. Send back data to gov. agency

An example of a workflow with R:

```{r workflowexample, eval=FALSE}
# data could be read directly from gov. agency but this is an other topic
my_network <- sf::read_sf("my_data.shp")               # read data into R 
mapview::mapview(my_network)                           # eyeball data 
# 2b still hard in R, but data could be tested 
my_network_planarCRS <- sf::st_transform(my_network
                                         , 32616)      # UTM 
my_buffer <- sf::st_buffer(my_network_planarCRS, 500)  # buffer 500m
my_buffer_4326 <- sf::st_transform(my_buffer, 4326)    # transform back 
# data could also be send directly with R
```


- Code above is fully reproducible

- Volume/velocity of data: GPS/smartphone, UAV, Remote sensing etc..   

- "Interfaces to other software are part of R" (**Rcpp**, **reticulate**).

- Lot of flexibility to produce what you need (*your workflow*)

- Great spatial statistics  

## Software for geocomputation 

R (and Python) is an interpreted language : Read - Eval - Print Loop (REPL)  
- C++ : QGIS, GRASS, SAGA

- Java : GeoTools, JTS, Geoserver/Geonode

- Python: lot of API and can be used to call geoalgorithms in QGIS or ArcMap


## R spatial ecosystem

Two group of developments : 

- {sp} --> {sf}: https://r-spatial.org/ 

- {raster} --> {terra}: https://www.rspatial.org/

## The history of R-spatial

- 1990s development of numerous S scripts/package

- 2000  R packages for spatial methods (points patterns, geostatistics, EDA)

- 2008 Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R first edition ({rgdal} 2003, {sp} 2005)

- 2009:{Rgooglemaps}, {ggmap} (basemap for ggplot2)

- 2010: {rgeos} / {raster}

- 2018: Breaking change PROJ: `proj string` --> `WKT` 

- Huge increase in viz/carto packages: {gganimate}, {rayshader}, {tmap}, {mapview}, {mapsf}
